# SES

This project was completed using Pycharm and Django. 

Disclaimer: I tried for many hours but was unable to correctly deploy my website. I tried utilizing a variety of services such as AWS, Netlify, and Heroku but had no success in doing so. For that reason, I decided to attach a video of the website correctly functioning according to all of the criteria given in the MindSumo challenge. 

This project was extremely fun to work on, and actually became a personal source of news. 

Other than the paywall detection, all deliverables were addressed in my solution for this problem. I made three separate tabs correlating with the three different categories, and also added a tab with US top news for my own personal use! The homepage was simply made as an introduction to the website. 

NewsAPI was the only data source that I used, and searches made on each made were limited to the category of the tab of the user. How this was done can be seen in the source code. The results were displayed using cards, which is a Bootstrap-based template. I felt that this embodied what would be termed as "clever and visually pleasing."

All errors were addressed in the code.
*Different sized images were adjusted accordingly. 
*If a resource was not available, all errors were adjusted for accordingly. Filler words were put in the place of missing content, and a default image in the place of a missing thumbnail. 

In terms of file locations, all HTML documents can be found in newsweb/templates. Other files are located in their respective default locations.
